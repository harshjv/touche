<p class="p1">Postprocessing filters are applied to a video frame after it has been thresholded into a binary image. The purpose of postprocessing is to get rid of pixels that were thresholded to "white", but which are not part of valid blobs generated by touching the multitouch surface. For example, such pixels can be the result of camera noise.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="postprocessing%20filters.filters_postprocessing.jpg" alt="filters_postprocessing.jpg"></p>
<p class="p1">If the amount of error pixels after the thresholding stage is very large, you might want to go back to fiddling with the parameters of the thresholding and/or preprocessing stage. If there's only a small number of wrong pixels, it is usually possible to get rid of them in the postprocessing stage, though.</p>
<p class="p1">The following filters and settings are available in the postprocessing stage:</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Apply morphological "open" operation (3x3 shape)</b></p>
<p class="p1">This filter executes an "Open" operation on the thresholded binary image, using a 3x3 pixel kernel. An "Open" operation is an "erode" operator followed by a "dilate" operator. This is useful in order to get rid of stray white pixels that are created with the thresholding filter, while leaving larger blob areas intact.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Apply morphological "close" operation (3x3 shape)</b></p>
<p class="p1">When this filter is enabled, a morphological "close" operation with a 3x3 pixel kernel is executed on the thresholded binary image (after the "open" operation, if this filter is enabled too). A "close" operation is a "dilate" operator followed by an "erode" operator. If some of your blobs have holes in them because of a few pixels falling below the luminance threshold, this filter can be used to close these holes in order to generate solid blobs.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Shape (for morphological "open" and "close" filters)</b></p>
<p class="p1">This option enables you to choose the shape used as the kernel for the "open" and "close" operations. "Square" is a 3x3 solid block of pixels, whereas "Cross" is a 3x3 kernel where only the middle pixel and its 4-connected neighbours are set. Depending on which kernel shape is used, the results of the operations are slightly different. Also note that the "Cross" kernel executes faster than the "Square" one.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Passes (for morphological "open" and "close" filters)</b></p>
<p class="p1">The amount of passes for the "open" and "close" filters correspond to the amount of "erode" and "dilate" operations that are executed internally. As an example, if you select 3 passes for the "open" operation, 3 "erode" iterations will be followed by 3 "dilate" iterations. Passes for the "close" operation are handled similarly. Choosing more passes will generally emphasize the effect of the filter.</p>
<p class="p1">Please note that the more passes are selected, the slower the filter will execute.</p>
