Touchsmart TUIO Readme
======================

To run Touchsmart TUIO, navigate into the Contents/Windows sub-folder within the folder where this file is stored, then double-click on TouchsmartTUIO.exe.

DO NOT RENAME THE PARENT FOLDER OF WHERE THIS FILE IS STORED, NOR ANY OTHER FILE WITHIN THIS FOLDER TREE. COCOTRON (THE FRAMEWORK USED TO PORT SOME CODE IN THIS PROJECT FROM MACOS X TO WINDOWS) NEEDS THIS FOLDER STRUCTURE TO BE INTACT, AS IT MIMICS THE STRUCTURE OF APPLICATION BUNDLES ON OSX. RENAMING A FILE OR CHANGING THE FOLDER TREE STRUCTURE WILL BREAK THE PROGRAM.
