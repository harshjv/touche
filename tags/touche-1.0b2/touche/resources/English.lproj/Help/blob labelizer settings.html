<p class="p1">The labelizer is the component of the tracking pipeline that keeps track of blobs over multiple frames, so that you can recognize motions and gestures. It will assign a label to each blob that will stay constant across consecutive frames for as long as the blob is visible.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="blob%20labelizer%20settings.blob_labelizer_settings.jpg" alt="blob_labelizer_settings.jpg"></p>
<p class="p1">Currently, the blob labelizer only has a single configuration item:</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Number of consecutive frames to consider during blob matching</b></p>
<p class="p1">If this slider is set to a positive number, the labelizer will wait for the specified amount of frames before reporting a blob (or a change of its state) to the tracking clients. For example, if this setting is set to 2, the labelizer will only report a new blob if it has been existing for 2 frames, and it will only report a blob as having ended if it could not be matched in two consecutive frames.</p>
<p class="p1">Thusly, this option can be useful to do away with blobs generated by bad lighting or camera artifacts, that are only visible for very few consecutive frames. Also, it can be useful to track weak blobs that might not be recognized in some isolated frames.</p>
<p class="p1">Note that the more this setting is increased, the more memory and computational effort has to be put into the blob labelizing process. Additionally, large settings will introduce noticable "lag" into the tracking pipeline, as the labelizer will "hold back" events for multiple frames before finally reporting them.</p>
