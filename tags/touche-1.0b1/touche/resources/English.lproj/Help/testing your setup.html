<p class="p1">After <a href="configuring%20touch%C3%A9.html">configuring</a> and <a href="calibration.html">calibrating</a> your setup, you can give it a quick test run by using the built-in Touché test application. Though very simple, it is a good way to see wether touches are recognized and tracked reliably by your setup and wether the camera to screen coordinate conversion works well.</p>
<p class="p1">You can start the test tool by selecting "Test Your Setup..." from the "Setup" menu.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="testing%20your%20setup.touch_test.jpg" alt="touch_test.jpg"></p>
<p class="p1">The test tool is a simple multitouch application, where colored dots are supposed to appear under your finger when you touch the surface. These dots will stay under your finger while you move it around, but they will disappear again when you lift your finger off.</p>
<p class="p1">Differents sounds will be played when a dot appears or disappears. You can use these sounds as an additional means of testing: If you place your finger on the surface and hear a sound, but don't see a dot, you know that something is wrong and needs being looked into.</p>
<p class="p1">Play with the test application in order to see wether everything works well (recognition of blobs, camera to screen coordinate conversion, tracking speed, etc.).</p>
<p class="p1">You can quit the test application by hitting the "Escape" key if it is running on your Mac's main screen, or by selecting the Touché test tool in the client list and telling it to quit via the contextual menu that appears when you right-click the entry (see "<a href="telling%20multitouch%20applications%20to%20quit.html">Telling multitouch applications to quit</a>").</p>
