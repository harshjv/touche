Build Instructions
==================

In order to build the windows target, you need to have use Cocotron within Apple's XCode.

You can obtain Cocotron from <http://code.google.com/p/cocotron>. The official website of Cocotron is <http://cocotron.org>.

Since Cocotron is a work-in-progress and in constant flux, building with the latest version might not work. This is because our target uses a lot of workarounds for bugs and stuff that's not yet implemented in Cocotron, but might be in a future version, causing a conflict or other weird behavior during building.

However, since the Google Code page hosts an SVN repository, you can check out the Cocotron code revision that the windows target was designed for.

Currently, you want rev 407 of the CF branch of Cocotron. To check it out via SVN, use the following command:

svn -r407 http://cocotron.googlecode.com/svn/branches/CF cocotron-src

Also, you NEED to apply my fix from revision 415. This is absolutely necessary, otherwise the built program will deadlock. You can get the patch from <http://code.google.com/p/cocotron/source/detail?r=415> and apply it manually.

Other than that, just follow the instructions from <http://cocotron.org> to build the Cocotron toolchain and the frameworks. Next, you should build the -windows target in our xcode project. Be sure to use XCode 3.1 or later.
