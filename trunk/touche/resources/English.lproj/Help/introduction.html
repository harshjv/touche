<p class="p1">Touché is a touch tracking application for use in conjunction with an <a href="optical%20multitouch%20table.html">optical multitouch table</a>. It provides powerful image filters, built-in calibration and test tools as well as support for types of cameras as input input sources.</p>
<p class="p1">Additionally, Touché enables you to build your own multitouch applications by embedding the Touché framework in your own app. Via this framework, you can establish a connection to the tracker and receive data for touch events conveniently via delegate methods. The framework also includes some useful classes to facilitate the writing of multitouch applications, such as some gesture recognizers.</p>
<p class="p1">Touché also supports the <a href="tuio.html">TUIO protocol</a>, which you can also use as a means to relay tracking data to your own application. TUIO libraries are available for a large range of environments and languages, such as C++, Processing and Quartz Composer.</p>
<p class="p1">Additionally to TUIO/OSC, Touché can also output tracking data via <a href="tuio_flash%20xml-socket%20clients.html">TUIO/Flash XML-Socket</a>, which is convenient if you are using Flash/AS3 to develop multitouch applications.</p>
<p class="p1">Touché is free open-source software.</p>
